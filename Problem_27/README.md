## Problem 27 - [Quadratic primes](https://projecteuler.net/problem=27)

Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n^{2}%2Bn%2B41)

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0≤n≤39). However, when ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n=40,40^{2}%2B40%2B41=40(40%2B1)%2B41) is divisible by 41, and certainly when ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n=41,41^{2}%2B41%2B41) is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n^{2}%2D79n%2B+1601) was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0≤n≤79). The product of the coefficients, ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%2D79) and ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1601), is ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%2D126479).

Considering quadratics of the form:

> ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n^{2}%2Ban%2Bb)
>
> where
>
>  ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|a|<1000)
>
> and
>
>  ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|b|≤1000)
>
> where![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|n|) is the modulus/absolute value of ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n)
>e.g. ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|11|=11) and ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|%2D4|=4)

Find the product of the coefficients, aa and bb, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n),starting with ![ ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n=0).

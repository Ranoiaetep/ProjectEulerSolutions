# Project Euler Solutions and Explanations

#### What is [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)?

> > Project Euler was started by Colin Hughes (a.k.a. euler) in October 2001 as a sub-section on [mathschallenge.net](http://mathschallenge.net/).
>
> > Since then the membership has continued to grow and Project Euler moved to its own domain in 2006.

With over 700 questions published on the site, each question was developed and managed by a group of their members.

Each question would have their own difficulties which might range from pretty easy to quite hard.

Despite its difficulties, most of the question does not need much math skills beyond some basic algebras. While certain math knowledge is required, such as ***prime number* **or ***Pythagorean theorem***, nothing really crazy is involved.
